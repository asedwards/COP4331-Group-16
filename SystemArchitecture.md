# Program Organization

Populate each section with information as it applies to your project. If a section does not apply, explain why. Include diagrams (or links to diagrams) in each section, as appropriate. For example, sketches of the user interfaces along with an explanation of how the interface components will work; ERD diagrams of the database; rough class diagrams; context diagrams showing the system boundary; etc.

# Major Classes

# Data Design
Database ERD: https://imgur.com/a/E8P2qQk
# Business Rules
Develop an fully operacional program using the agile methodology.

# User Interface Design

# Resource Management
Aubrey has the consumer role. Lucas and Austin are working with the documentation. Andrew and Caleb are doing code. 

# Security
"Get Your Shit Together" will test for SQL injections on each user input.

# Performance
Every page of the backlog is assessible within 6 clicks from every order page. Sorting and organization algorithms are on the order of n^2. The suggestions algorithms are performed within 10 seconds delay. 

# Scalability
  As the backlog gets more massive because of the information inputted on it the program itself shouldn't crash. Also additional new features for the backlog can be added. New types of backlogs should with specific features should be easy to add.        
# Interoperability
  The backlog is on


# Internationalization/Localization
Unnecessary for the scope of this project.

# Input/Output
The user should input the name of the video game/anime/movies/ and received specifications from the database as well as an organized list classified by the current status of the game.   

# Error Processing
If an object searched by the user is not found in the database the user will be given an option to add a custom entry. If the item was suppose to be there it the program will return an error message. Every major bug in the backlog will be handled by an error message since robustness is more important than correctness in this program.   
# Fault Tolerance
The backlog is robust in nature unless a major crash occur the program will not shutdown. But the program will shutdown if certains it reaches a timeout.

# Architectural Feasibility
The project is very feasible. The only part that might be more difficult than expected is the database and API setup and the incentive. Since the incentive might include animation.

# Overengineering
Unnecessary features will be trimmed off. The user interface will be maintained clean as much as possible.   

# Build-vs-Buy Decisions
We will build Get Your Shit Together without buying any additional pieces of software or hardware.

# Reuse
Most of the reuse will be accomplished by using abstract classes. 

# Change Strategy
Since the classes of the program are not tightly coupled it should be easy to add new features. Even starting everything from scratch if necessary.
